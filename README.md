Model Overview

This backend uses a pre-trained text-to-text Transformer model from Hugging Face, specifically:

üß© Model Used: t5-small (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

It‚Äôs a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model designed by Google, trained to convert an input text (paragraph) into another text output (title) by learning contextual understanding of words and phrases.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Simplified Flow)

Input:
The user sends a paragraph (story description, article, etc.) to the FastAPI endpoint /generate-title.

Tokenization:
The text is tokenized by the T5Tokenizer, converting words into numerical tokens that the model understands.

Model Inference:
The tokens are passed to the T5 model (T5ForConditionalGeneration), which uses its encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to generate a concise, contextually relevant title.

Decoding:
The output token IDs are decoded back into readable text ‚Äî this becomes your generated story title.

Response:
The generated title is sent as a JSON response to the user.
